== What are GraphGists ?

http://neo4j.com[Neo4j] GraphGists are an easy way to create and share documents containing not just prose, structure 
and pictures but most importantly **example graph models and use-cases** expressed in Neo4j's query language http://docs.neo4j.org/refcard/2.1/[Cypher].

These documents are written in the simple, textual Markup language AsciiDoc and rendered in your browser as rich and interactive
web pages that you can quickly evolve from describing simple howtos or questions to providing an extensive use-case specification.

To see the expressive power of this approach, here are the winners of our community competitions:

=== It is really easy to get started:

0. **Log into** your GitHub account
1. **choose** one of the examples listed above, click the green **page source** button.
2. **fork** the original GraphGist into your own account and **start to edit** the prose, images, setup and use-case Cypher queries
3. **paste** the Github Gist URL into the top right URL box of any GraphGist page, your Gist will be loaded and rendered immediately
4. **reload** your GraphGist page whenever you made an update to your document
5. **share** your GraphGist with your colleagues, friends or us, hit the submit link in the footer, when you are ready to get your t-shirt reward

=== Setup a Graph to show you and your Likes

And render as a graph.

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (you:Person {name:"You"})-[like:LIKE]->(us:Database:NoSql:Graph {name:"Neo4j" })
RETURN you,like,us
----

//graph

=== Now query the graph to show all the things you like

And render as a table.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (you:Person {name:"You"})-[like:LIKE]->(us:Database:NoSql:Graph {name:"Neo4j" })
RETURN you.name as who ,type(like) as how,us.name as what
----

//table
